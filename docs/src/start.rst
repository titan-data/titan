Getting Started
===============

This is a slightly more detailed version of the
`community guide <https://titan-data.io/getting-started>`_, and will explain
a bit more about what's going on under the hood with more detailed examples.

For a quick tour getting started, check out the following sections:

* :ref:`lifecycle_install`
* :ref:`local_run`
* :ref:`local_commit`
