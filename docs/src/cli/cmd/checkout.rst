.. _cli_cmd_checkout:

titan checkout
==============

Checks out a previous commit into the current container. The commit must be
present in `titan log`. For more general information on managing local
commits, see the :ref:`local_commit` section. For more information on how to
pull commits from remote repositories, see the :ref:`remote` section.

.. warning::

   This will stop and start the associated docker container if it is already
   running. This will interrupt any active connections, and may require
   client-specific actions to reconnect.

Syntax
------

::

    titan checkout [-c id] [-t key[=value] ...] <repository>

Arguments
---------

repository
    *Required*. The name of the target repository.

Options
-------

-c, --commit id         Specify the commit ID to checkout. Must be a
                        known commit in `titan log` for the given repository.
                        If this is not specified, then the source commit
                        is used, unless tags are specified in which case the
                        latest matching commit is used instead. See the
                        :ref:`cli_cmd_status` command for more info on the
                        source commit.

-t, --tag tag           Filter commits by the specified tag(s).
                        More than one of this option can be specified.
                        Tags cannot be used if the ``-c`` option is
                        specified. When tags are specified, then the latest
                        commit matching those tags is checked out.
                        Tags are matched according to the filtering rules
                        described in the :ref:`local_tags` section.
